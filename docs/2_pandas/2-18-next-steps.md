# 18. Next steps

1. **Further practice using this repo**: Apply the principles to the 'medal_standings' dataframe, e.g.:

    - check for missing values
    - check for issues with categorical data
    - remove columns
    - check and change datatypes

2. **Other tutorials**: Data preparation with pandas is a popular topic, a search shows there are many free tutorials. A
   few:
    - https://realpython.com/pandas-plot-python/
    - https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/data-cleaning-and-preprocessing-with-pandasbdvhj/
    - https://www.w3schools.com/python/pandas/default.asp
    - https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/10min.html
    - https://www.kaggle.com/learn/pandas

3. **AI guidance**:Use Copilot or chatGPT and ask for advice on using particular pandas functions. Try the pandasai
   library.

4. **Find example from others, e.g. Kaggle**: There are lots of data sets and often examples of data preparation others
   have carried out. For example look at
   the [120 year of Olympic history](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results).
   This is a larger dataset than the one used in this tutorial and there are many code examples from others that use
   this dataset (some better than others!).

5. **Finally, apply the knowledge to your coursework project!**

   As a third year module, the coursework is not meant to be a series of instructions to follow. However, to get you
   started this week here are some suggestions of what to do:

    - Install pandas and openpyxl in the virtual environment of your coursework project in your IDE.
    - Use pandas to read the data into a dataframe.
    - Write code to describe the dataframe contents e.g. size, column names, datatypes, statistics.
    - Write code to explore the data in more detail e.g. consider missing values, incorrect data types, unique
      values in columns, plot ranges of values in columns, and investigate outliers in columns.
