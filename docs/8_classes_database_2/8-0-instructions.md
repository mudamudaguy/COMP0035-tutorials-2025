# Coding activities 8: Working with classes and databases part 2

_*Theme: Using Python to work with data*_

This week returns to working with classes and databases and focuses on the SQLModel library as you will use this in
COMP0034.

Note that for coursework 2 you can use SQLAlchemy rather than SQLModel if you prefer. SQLAlchemy arguably has a steeper
learning curve, however some students may already have experience of this in which case use it. SQLModel uses SQLAlchemy.

You may not need all the insert, select, update and query methods to complete the coursework. You will likely
need insert to add data in order to do the testing.

[Instructions](8-0-instructions.md) are in the docs/8_classes_database_2 folder:

1. [Adding methods to classes](8-01-methods.md)
2. [Creating relationships between tables in SQLModel](8-02-relationships.md)
3. [Add data using SQLModel](8-03-insert.md)
4. [Add data to tables with relationships](8-04-insert-multiple.md)
5. [Selecting data from a database with SQLModel](8-05-select.md)
6. [Update data in a database with SQLModel](8-07-update.md)
7. [Delete data from a database with SQLModel](8-06-delete.md)
8. [Reminder: code quality still matters!](8-08-quality.md)
